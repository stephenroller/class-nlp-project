\section{Introduction}

%Motivate and abstractly describe the problem you are addressing and how you are addressing it. What is the problem? Why is it important? What is your basic approach? A short discussion of how it fits into related work in the area is also desirable. Summarize the basic results and conclusions that you will present. 

We describe a novel method for tagging unknown nouns with supersenses using Search Engine queries to refine an initial precomputed approximation.
A noun's {\em supersense} is the name given in the literature to highest meaningful level of meaning in the WordNet \cite{wordnet} hierarchy---these are abstract concepts such as {\it food}, {\it person}, or {\it cognition} \cite{cj}.

We provide a novel solution to the problem which uses a model built from a relatively small offline corpus to provide a first approximation, and then further refines this approximation by querying a search engine.
This broad approach---use a rough model to construct an approximation and refine with search engine queries---could be generalized to many other tasks.
In that sense, our contribution is not an algorithm to solve the problem of acquisition of supersenses of unknown nouns {\it per se}, but is rather a method for using search engine queries to refine first approximations from rough models, which we apply to the task of supersense acquisition for illustrative purposes.

We construct a rough approximation using a simplified version of the distributional approach taken by Curran \cite{curran}, and refine using the Bing API.

\section{Problem Definition and Algorithm}

\subsection{Task Definition}

%Precisely define the problem you are addressing (i.e. formally specify the inputs and outputs). Elaborate on why this is an interesting and important problem. 

The task of supersense acquisition of unknown nouns was first described in \cite{cj}.
The problem is, given a word,  assign to that word one of the WordNet {\it supersenses} (also called {\it lexicographer classes}).
A listing of all the WordNet supersenses may be found in Figure \ref{fig:supersenses}.
\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\begin{tabular}{llllllll}
1& person & 8& possession&  15& process&  22& body \\
2& communication & 9& location& 16& Tops&  23& feeling \\
3& artifact & 10& substance&  17& phenomenon& 24& shape \\
4& act & 11& state& 18& event&  25& plant \\
5& group & 12& time& 19& quantity&  26& relation \\
6& food & 13&  attribute& 20& motive \\
7& cognition& 14& object& 21& animal \\
\end{tabular}

\end{figure}
\end{center}

Call a word {\it ambiguous} if it is attested as having more than one supersense in Wordnet.
We follow the literature in restricting ourselves to only attempting to guess supersenses for unambiguous nouns \cite{cj}\cite{curran}.

Supersense information for unknown nouns is conceivably useful for a number of tasks---parsing or POS tagging, for example, could both benefit from supersense information.
Similarly, Word Sense Disambiguation could be aided by supersense information---one could apply selectional restrictions to nouns with guessed supersenses to help disambiguate.
Since lexical resources like WordNet are necessarily incomplete, the utility of being able to guess nominal supersenses is clear.



\subsection{Algorithm Definition}

Describe in reasonable detail the algorithm you are using to address this problem. A psuedocode description of the algorithm you are using is frequently useful. Trace through a concrete example, showing how your algorithm processes this example. The example should be complex enough to illustrate all of the important aspects of the problem but simple enough to be easily understood. If possible, an intuitively meaningful example is better than one with meaningless symbols. 

\section{Experimental Evaluation}

\subsection{Methodology}

What are criteria you are using to evaluate your method? What specific hypotheses does your experiment test? Describe the experimental methodology that you used. What are the dependent and independent variables? What is the training/test data that was used, and why is it realistic or interesting? Exactly what performance data did you collect and how are you presenting and analyzing it? Comparisons to competing methods that address the same problem are particularly useful. 

\subsection{Results}

%Present the quantitative results of your experiments. Graphical data presentation such as graphs and histograms are frequently better than tables. What are the basic differences revealed in the data. Are they statistically significant?

Is your hypothesis supported? What conclusions do the results support about the strengths and weaknesses of your method compared to other methods? How can the results be explained in terms of the underlying properties of the algorithm and/or the data. 

\section{Related Work}

%Answer the following questions for each piece of related work that addresses the same or a similar problem. What is their problem and method? How is your problem and method different? Why is your problem and method better? 

There are two papers about the particular task of supersense acquisition of nouns.
The first, in which the task is first described, is by Ciaramita \& Johnson \cite{cj}.
They apply a multiclass perceptron classifier which uses a mix of features standardly used in NER, WSD, and lexical disambiguation---parts of speech of neighboring words, $n$-grams in surrounding contexts, and morphological features, for example.
They train on two corpora by, for each unambiguous noun with an entry in WordNet 1.6, calculating a feature vector for each occurrence of that noun.
One corpus is the Bllip corpus, a 40M word corpus of WSJ text; the other is comprised of the definitional glosses collected from WordNet.
The method given in this paper is based entirely on using offline, preprocessed corpora, and augmenting it with results from search engine queries could be fruitful.

The task is approached differently by Curran \cite{curran}.
He uses a more unsupervised approach---construct a distributional vector space model from a large corpus and use a $k$-nearest-neighbors voting scheme to guess the supersense label of an unknown word.
Our basic, offline model is an impoverished version of Curran's---whereas the dimensions in his model correspond to nouns being observed standing in different relations to verbs (e.g. ``being the direct object of {\it give}''), the dimensions in our model correspond simply to nouns being observed within the local contexts of other words.
Our general approach differs from his in that we attempt to also use a search engine---both to augment the initial vector for the unknown word with a greater number of contexts, and also to refine our guess for what the $k$-nearest neighbor vectors are.

The idea of using the web to build models for natural language processing tasks is certainly not novel.
For example, \cite{bollegala} and \cite{gracia} use the results of search engine queries to calculate semantic similarity between terms.
\cite{strube} and \cite{gabrilovich} also use the web to calculate semantic similarity, but restrict themselves to Wikipedia.
However, as far as we know, there is no prior work using the web to guess supersenses of unknown words.
Further, we believe use of search engine queries to refine an initial approximate answer provided by an offline model (in contrast to building a model from the web) is not a widely used technique.
This is the primary contribution of the present work.

\section{Future Work}

%What are the major shortcomings of your current method? For each shortcoming, propose additions or enhancements that would help overcome it. 

[SHORTCOMINGS OF METHOD, POSSIBLE ENHANCEMENTS]

The general approach we take is to construct a rough first approximation of an answer from a relatively small offline corpus and then use a search engine to refine this approximation.
This approach could be fruitful for a number of different tasks---guessing word similarity or automatically finding synonyms, for example.
Any task whose process of constructing a solution admits refinement with a search engine  could potentially see improvement using this method.
